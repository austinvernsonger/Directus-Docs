Item Listing
======================

This is one of the more useful and data-rich pages within Directus. It
provides a tabular listing of all the items (records) within the
selected table. Clicking the (+) at the top of the page will create a
new item in this table, or click on any of the listed items to view/edit
it. Beyond this basic functionality, there are also these other features
covered below:

--------------

Filtering
~~~~~~~~~

The “Add Filter” dropdown will add inputs for searching/filtering within
specific fields. Each filter you add is considered an “AND” (not “OR”) –
for example, with the filters ``title="Happy"`` and
``location="New York"`` items would have to match (contain) both. There
are several input types for filters: date-chooser, checkbox, dropdown,
auto-complete, and the default text-box. Clicking the “×” inside the
input will remove that filter.

--------------

Active, Inactive, & Delete
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For tables that contain a *Status* column (Directus uses ``active`` by
default), when selecting items from the listing page you will have the
option to change their active status: \* **Active** – These items are
considered live/published. A value of “1” is saved. \* **Draft** – Items
in draft mode are grayed out visually and this column is saved with a
value of 2. Applications should exclude these items from production
viewing. \* **Delete** – This effectively removes items from Directus.
Though no longer visible, due to the soft delete policy items are
maintained within the database with an active value of 0. Applications
should exclude these items from production viewing.

Additionally, there is a dropdown in the header for choosing which
item’s are visible based on status. The options here are:

-  **View All** – Shows Active and Draft items. *While deleted items may
   still exist they are never shown in Directus.*
-  **View Active** – Shows Active items only
-  **View Draft** – Shows Draft items only

    **Developer Note:** Remember to respect the above statuses by only
    fetching active items (active=1) in your product’s data queries.
    Updating the config file to change the default *Status* field name,
    allowed values, and colors.

Changing Visible Columns
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default the item listing page shows the first few columns of data for
any given table. Users can then adjust which columns they see by
hovering over the gray table header and clicking the gear on the right –
in the dropdown that opens, choose up to eight (8) fields to show. Due
to their complexity, many-to-many fields such as the Slideshow UI can
not be shown.

--------------

Sorting
~~~~~~~

As is the case with most tabular data, clicking column headers will sort
the data by that field. Clicking a column again will reverse the sort
direction – clicking a third time will remove sorting reverting to the
default: date created. This is automatically saved on a per user basis
and is persistent until changed.

--------------

Reordering
~~~~~~~~~~

While sorting simply changes the current view of the items, reordering
actually *saves* th
