Login
=======

If you attempt to access Directus without being authenticated, you will
be directed to the login page. Once successfully logged in, if you were
initially following a link to a certain page you will be redirected
there – otherwise you’ll be taken to the last page you visited within
Directus.

    **Developer Note:** That the Directus version is displayed in the
    bottom-left corner of the login screen. Hovering over the version
    will reveal the exact git commit hash of your version.

--------------

Forgot Password
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Directus always salts and securely encrypts your password, so no one,
not even admins, can see your actual password in plain-text. Therefore
no one can tell you what your password is – if forgotten, it must be
reset. To reset your password, navigate to the login page, fill in your
email address, and click the “?” within the password input. You will
receive an email with a link to reset your password that is valid for a
short period of time.

--------------

Logging Out
~~~~~~~~~~~

It’s a good habit to log out of Directus when not actively using it –
especially on public computers/devices. The logout button is always
available at the bottom of the sidebar, beside your user avatar.
Administrators of your system may choose to set an Auto Logout Duration
for idle users – by default this is set to 1 hour.

    **Security Note:** Leaving your computer awake and unattended while
    your Directus user is logged-in could result in a security breach.
